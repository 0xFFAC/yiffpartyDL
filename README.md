# yiffpartyDL
This script downloads posts and attachments from yiff.party. I'm new coding so the code is shit, use it at your own risk.

### Usage
To run the script you need Python3 with _BeautifulSoup4_ module, and the yiff.party ID of the account you want to download. The ID is the number end of the url. run:

```python3 yiffparty-dl.py YIFFPARTY-ID-HERE```

The script creates a new folder named after the account you want to download in the current working directory.
